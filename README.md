# DAWE RLP Specification

This repository contains the specification requirements and validators for the DAWE RLP field survey protocols developed by TERN.

## SHACL shapes

SHACL shapes reside in the `shapes/` directory. The `shapes/` directory contains subdirectories to each of the protocol modules. Each protocol module contains Turtle files where each file defines shape constraints to validate based on the protocol's observable property.
