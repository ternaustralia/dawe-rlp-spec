# DAWE RLP Specification

This repository contains the specification requirements and validators for the DAWE RLP field survey protocols developed by TERN.

## SHACL shapes

SHACL shapes reside in the `shapes/` directory. The `shapes/` directory contains subdirectories to each of the protocol modules. Each protocol module contains a directory named after an observable property. This observable property directory contains 3 RDF Turtle files:

- `shapes.ttl` - the shapes for the observable property
- `valid.ttl` - valid examples
- `invalid.ttl` - invalid examples
